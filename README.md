# ergodox-ez-PT_pt

Configuration for the ergodox-ez containing Portuguese-specific characters and accents

## Why

The ergodox-ez doesn't support PT symbols such as รง and all the accents and key combinations are a pain to set up in the configurator. So feel free to check it out if you're facing the same challenge.

You can also find it online at https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/layouts/Bn9v/latest/0

Have fun!
